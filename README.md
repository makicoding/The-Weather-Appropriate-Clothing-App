# WeatherTastic App

https://makicoding.github.io/The-Weather-Appropriate-Clothing-App/index.html

An App that gives a recommendation of what to wear and pack based on the weather.

Imagine this: you are about to go on a trip to London for a few days and you need to pack. You have the basics down, the easy stuff like underwear and socks.  But what about all the hard stuff? Should you pack a jacket, or do you need a winter coat? Do you need an umbrella and rain boots? What if you could put in a location and dates into an app and it would give you a recommendation of what to wear and pack? What if you do not have an item on the recommended list, you could just click a button, the app would take you to Amazon where you could purchase the item, have it delivered to your door the very next day, in time for your trip?  Wouldn't that be fantastic?  We decided to solve that, and we built WeatherTastic.
