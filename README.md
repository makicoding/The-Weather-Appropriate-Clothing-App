An App that gives a recommendation of what to wear and pack based on the weather.

This is a group project of a five member team.

### The Problem and The Technical Solution:
Imagine this: you are about to go on a trip to London for a few days and you need to pack. You have the basics down, the easy stuff like underwear and socks.  But what about all the hard stuff? Should you pack a jacket, or do you need a winter coat? Do you need an umbrella and rain boots? What if you could put in a location and dates into an app and it would give you a recommendation of what to wear and pack? What if you do not have an item on the recommended list, you could just click on a button, the app would take you to Amazon where you could purchase the item, have it delivered to your door the very next day, in time for your trip?  Wouldn't that be fantastic?  We decided to solve that, and we built WeatherTastic.
<br>
<br>
We started the design process by considering what sort of a device a user would most likely use the app on. We believed it would be on a smartphone. And so using this screensize as our base, we came up with UI designs in Adobe XD. We wanted the design to be universal and so we incorporated large buttons with clothing icons on them. The entire CSS was coded from the ground up.

While we were creating the UI designs for WeatherTastic, we researched APIs including the Google Maps API, and also the Darksky API. We also came up with the overall framework for our JavaScript during this time. Once the UI designs were presented to the team, discussed, and our final design was picked, we started coding both the front end and back end simultaneously.
